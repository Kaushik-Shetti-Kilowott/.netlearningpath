To find mean 
We need to take the sum of the numbers in the array and then divide it by the total number of elements,This gives us the mean of all the elements
To find median
We need to first the elements in either ascending or descending order and if there are odd numbers the median is n/2 and if therea re even numbers median is (n+1)/2
To find mode
We need to compare the adjacent elements in the array and if 2 numbers are same then we have to increase the counter value by one
Then we have to update with the maxcount and then update the count variable accordingly and set max num to be the current element 
This execution should continue till the loop is traversed till the end
